# TODO:
X - Remove all occurrences of:
X - audio
X - epub
X - ascii
X - csv
X - See todos from Snotepad.
X - Fix: search when launched from inside a file (8cc1d0def12211bcc1886e95471bf86895171d35 breaks file search)
X - call them notes 1 & notes 2
X - Remove bottom bar in text editing
X - do not open multiple instances (single instance only), not one for each file and for each reopened file. I.e just like snotepad
X - Change the versioning to match the new versions
X - remove the bottom dark bar (Files)
X - change app name from markor to notepad2
X - one click starts new note with date and time
X - scrollbar always visible + clickable

- darker scrollbars (make ones in files list always visible, this was previously attempted in 2bfc4d86d3a06eb0390e6b9e6daa20e723cbc079)
- Add more highlighting (file:///home/elias/Library/Projects/3-Writing-Tools/Notepad2-markor/app/src/main/java/net/gsantner/opoc/format/GsSimpleMarkdownParser.java)
- highlight briefly when going back (see Merge requests on github)
- total notes count (+ on folders?)
