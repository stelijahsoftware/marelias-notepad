[m] - rename to mar-elias notes (see commit "Rename app to notepad2" and "Rename folder from markor to notepad2" (Jul17))
- Don't use currentTimeMillis(), instead copy the stamp from the just written file https://github.com/gsantner/markor/pull/2422#issuecomment-2365364977

[h] - Add an about screen that shows the original developer (+ a link to his github) + license name + my own link
